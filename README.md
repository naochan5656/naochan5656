## 👏 Hi! I'm Nao.

## About me

Free-spirited Server Engineer
I build Discord bots with JavaScript and design Minecraft plugins with Java.

## My public repository

All my projects are developed privately.
My repositories should contain nothing but a README.
I use GitHub for project management, not for publishing.
