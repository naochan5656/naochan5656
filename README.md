## 👏 Hi! I'm Nao.

## 📕About me

Free-spirited Server Engineer

I build Discord bots with JavaScript and design Minecraft plugins with Java.

## 🔍My public repository

All my projects are developed privately.

My repositories should contain nothing but a README.

I use GitHub for project management, not for publishing.
